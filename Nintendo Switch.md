# How to add @Snuggle on Nintendo Switch?
## Through Twitter (Preferred)
My preferred way to add friends on the Switch is through the 'Mutual Twitter follows' feature. This is because it will include your Twitter handle in the friends list and makes it much easier to keep track of who is who.

## Set-up Twitter Link

## Mutual Follows
Make sure you follow me at https://snuggle.link/twitter, and that I follow you back! (Feel free to DM me if you're not being followed)

Then I should pop-up in your 'Friend Suggestions' on your Switch. Click on me and we'll be friends!

### Becoming Twitter Friends!
It should look like this when I receive your friend request!

And finally, this is what I should look like in your friend list â€” all done!

## Through Friend Code
This can be difficult to remember who is who, but you can add me via friend code below:
